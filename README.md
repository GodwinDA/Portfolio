## About Me

I'm a **Smart Contract Security Researcher** focused on finding vulnerabilities in blockchain applications. I audit smart contracts written in **Solidity, Move, and Rust** for different blockchain ecosystems.

I actively participate in security competitions and audits on platforms like **Code4rena, Sherlock, Cantina, and CodeHawks**. Through my work, I’ve helped identify and fix security risks in various blockchain projects. 

I have experience auditing **multiple protocols** across public contests and private engagements. I’m always looking for interesting security challenges and new collaborations. Let’s work together to make Web3 more secure!
